1. How to run
To run this, cd into the build folder and run a3. Currently the constants are configured to get a good output for "./a3 t 0.01" and "./a3 r 0.01". Euler explodes.

2. Collaboration
I talked a bit with Danny and Allan Gelman about the general data structures to make for efficient computation. I heard about the instructor suggestion to precompute the spring values but ended up not implementing that in my cloth.

3. References
The class slides for the RK algorithm were very useful!

4. Known problems
Currently my constants are calibrated to the input listed in 1, so changing them could lead to unpredictable behavior. To make my cloth even less droopy, I could have made a variable spring constant that is greater at the top particles.

5. Extra credit
N/A

6. Comments
I really liked this Pset! I was initially intimidated by the amount of design space we had available but office hours cleared things right up.
